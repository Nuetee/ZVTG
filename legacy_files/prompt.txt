    "Given a sentence that may contain multiple actions or simultaneous actions, identify the subject(s), verb(s), and object(s) for each action. Then, perform the following replacements:

    1. Subject replacement
    If the sentence contains multiple subjects (e.g., separated by commas), replace each subject one by one with an appropriate pronoun (he/she/they for singular, they for plural). If any subject is already a pronoun (e.g., he, she, they), replace it with 'Someone.'
    
    2. Verb replacement
    For sentences with multiple verbs, replace each verb one by one with a more general action verb like 'performs an action' or 'acts on.'

    3. Object replacement
    For sentences with multiple objects, replace each object one by one according to the following rules:
    - If the object is a noun:
        - If it refers to a person, replace it with 'him', 'her', or 'them' depending on singularity and gender.
        - If it refers to a thing, replace it with 'it' for singular or 'them' for plural.
    - If the object is already a pronoun:
        - If the pronoun refers to a person:
        Replace it with 'someone' for singular or 'people' or 'individuals' for plural.
        - If the pronoun refers to a thing:
        Replace it with 'something' for singular or 'some things' for plural.

    Your task involves two stages when processing user text input describing human activities in a video:

    1. Stage 1: Revise the input to be more natural.
    - Fix unnatural phrasing: If the user input sounds awkward or unnatural, revise it to make the phrasing more natural.
    - Simplify complex expressions: If the user input contains complex expressions, simplify them into clearer and more straightforward language.
    - Replace difficult or uncommon words: If the user input uses difficult or uncommon words, replace them with more commonly used and simpler words.
    - If the user input is already natural, free of complex expressions, and uses commonly understood words, you do not need to make any changes. In that case, return the user input as is.

    2. Stage 2: After revising the input, perform subject, verb, and object replacements.
    - Subject replacement: For each subject in the revised sentence, replace it with an appropriate pronoun (he/she/they for singular, they for plural). If the subject is already a pronoun or is a general term like "Someone" or "A person" that cannot be further generalized, return an empty array for subject replacement.
    - Verb replacement: For each verb, replace it with a more general action verb like "performs an action" or "acts on."
    - Object replacement: For each object, apply the following rules:
        - If the object is a noun:
            - If it refers to a person, replace it with "him", "her", or "them" depending on singularity and gender.
            - If it refers to a thing, replace it with "it" for singular or "them" for plural.
        - If the object is already a pronoun:
            - If it refers to a person, replace it with "someone" for singular or "people" or "individuals" for plural.
            - If it refers to a thing, replace it with "something" for singular or "some things" for plural.
        - If the sentence has no object, return an empty array for object replacement.

    **Important:** 
    - Ensure the output is valid JSON without any extra formatting like code blocks or tags.
    - Do not include any extra characters like ```json or similar markers.
    - All responses must be valid, properly formatted JSON.
